1- Planning and Research:

Understand the scope and purpose of your website.
Research existing medical prediction models and algorithms.
Determine the features and functionalities you want to include.
Design and User Interface:
2- Design a user-friendly interface for inputting symptoms and medical history.

Consider using forms and dropdown menus for data entry.
Ensure accessibility and readability of the interface.
3- Frontend Development:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the frontend interface.
Implement client-side validation to ensure data integrity.
4- Backend Development:

Choose a backend technology stack (e.g., PHP with MySQL database).
Implement server-side logic to process user input and make predictions.
Integrate with relevant APIs or databases for medical data and disease information.
Ensure security measures to protect sensitive user data.
5- Machine Learning or Predictive Modeling:

Develop or integrate machine learning algorithms for disease prediction.
Train the model using historical medical data (if available).
Continuously update and improve the model based on feedback and new data.
6- Ethical Considerations:

Clearly communicate the limitations and uncertainties of the predictions.
Obtain consent from users for data collection and analysis.
Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA in the United States).
7- Testing and Quality Assurance:

Test the website thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
Conduct usability testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
Verify the accuracy and reliability of disease predictions.
Deployment and Maintenance:
8- Deploy the website on a reliable web hosting platform.

Monitor the performance and security of the website.
Regularly update the website with new features and improvements.

This ER Diagram explains the hospital management system. 
The entities here are-


i) 'Doctors' who treat the patients <br>
ii) 'Patients' who are diagnosed & treated by the doctors  <br>
iii) 'Room' having attributes Room Number & Floor Number with Room Number being the primaty key <br>
iv) 'Pharmacist' who sells prescribed drugs to the patients <br>
v) 'Cashier' who receives the payment of the medical bills paid by the patients <br>

<br>
<br>

There are several attrivutes used to explain each attribute & there are also multiple relationships used here. One example of relationship being the one-to-many relationship used to denote the relationship between a doctor & multiple patients. 

<br>
<br>

The primary keys are denoted by underlining the texts here.

<br>
Shapes & the meanings-  <br>
The rectangular boxes are used to denote entities. <br>
Ovals denote attributes. <br>
Diamonds denote relationships. <br>
The double oval drawn denotes multi-valued attribute. <br><br>
